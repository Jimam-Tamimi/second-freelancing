There are 11 levels in the program. 
So I will be having 11 qn sheets in excel format. 
I will need a way to upload the qns. The child can use the common login and click on the level he is in. 
For level 1 and 2 there will be abacus qns only for 5 minutes. 
For level 3 there will be abacus and mental maths qns for 8 minutes. 
For level 5 and above 5 minutes abacus, 3 minutes visual and 3 minutes multiplication/div. So for each level, the individual score for abacus , visual etc and time taken for each should be shown at the end . 
The scores neednâ€™t be saved.

3 type of question
    # abacus
    # visual
    # multiplication/div

level 1,2 - 5 minutes 
{
    # id
    # type
    # question 
}

    
level 3,4 - 8 minutes 
{
    # id
    # type
    # question
}

5 - 11 - 5 abacus, 
{
    # id
    # type
    # question
}

level 5-11 = 5 abacus : 3 visual : 3 minutes multiplication/div
{
    # id
    # type
    # question
}
